### PwC Virtual Internship - Power BI Dashboards
This repository showcases the Power BI dashboards created during my virtual internship at PwC. The internship involved applying data analysis and visualization skills to address real-world business problems for a telecom client. Throughout the internship, I developed dashboards to analyze customer service performance, customer retention strategies, and diversity & inclusion efforts.

Overview
During my PwC Virtual Internship, I worked on three tasks, each designed to provide insights and solutions for a telecom client. These tasks involved creating interactive Power BI dashboards to present actionable insights from raw data. The internship was part of PwC's initiative to upskill individuals and prepare them for a data-driven future.

Tasks
Task 1: Customer Service Dashboard
Objective:
Create a Power BI dashboard that visualizes customer service metrics for a telecom client. The goal was to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer satisfaction, call answer/abandon rates, average speed of answer, and agent performance. The dashboard helped the client identify areas for improvement in their customer service process.

Key KPIs:

Overall customer satisfaction
Calls answered vs. abandoned
Calls by time
Average speed of answer
Agent performance quadrant: average handle time vs. calls answered
Dashboard:

Task 2: Customer Retention Dashboard
Objective:
The telecom client was struggling with customer retention. The Retention Manager requested a dashboard to visualize KPIs related to customer churn and retention efforts. The goal was to define proper KPIs, such as retention rates and at-risk customers, and present them in a self-explanatory format for management.

Key KPIs:

Customer churn rate
Retention rate
At-risk customers
Retention efforts (by time)
Dashboard:

Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard
Objective:
The clientâ€™s Human Resources department was focused on improving gender balance at the executive management level but had not made significant progress. This task involved defining KPIs related to diversity and inclusion, specifically in hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover. The dashboard aimed to highlight potential areas for improvement and suggest root causes for the slow progress.

Key KPIs:

Gender distribution (overall, hiring, and promotions)
Percentage of women in management
Turnover rates (overall and by gender)
Average performance ratings (by gender)
