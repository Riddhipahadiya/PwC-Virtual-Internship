## Overview
During my PwC Virtual Internship, I worked on three tasks, each designed to provide insights and solutions for a telecom client. These tasks involved creating interactive Power BI dashboards to present actionable insights from raw data. The internship was part of PwC's initiative to upskill individuals and prepare them for a data-driven future.

## Project Motivation
The motivation for this project stemmed from the increasing importance of data-driven decision-making in the telecom industry. By creating dashboards, I aimed to provide clear and actionable insights that would help the client improve their customer service and retention strategies, as well as enhance diversity and inclusion within the organization.

## Tech Stack
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel**: For data preparation and analysis

## Prerequisites
Before using the dashboards, ensure you have the following:
- Microsoft Power BI installed on your system
- Access to the datasets used in the dashboards
- Basic understanding of Power BI and data visualization concepts

## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 1: Customer Service Dashboard for Claire
**Objective**:  
Develop a dashboard for a client (Claire) showcasing customer service KPIs to provide management with a clear overview of customer interactions and service quality.

- **KPIs included**:
  - Overall customer satisfaction
  - Calls answered vs. abandoned
  - Calls by time of day
  - Average speed of answer
  - Agent performance quadrant: average handle time vs. calls answered

The goal of this dashboard was to help Claire and her team understand where improvements were needed in handling customer queries and managing response times. This dashboard helped identify potential areas of optimization for better customer service performance.

### Task 2: Customer Retention Dashboard for Telecom Client
**Objective**:  
Create a customer retention dashboard for a telecom client to visualize at-risk customers and provide proactive measures to retain them.

- **KPIs included**:
  - Customer churn rate
  - Retention rate
  - Average customer lifespan
  - Predictive analysis of at-risk customers
  - Contract termination analysis

This dashboard focused on reducing churn by identifying customers who were most likely to cancel their contracts. It provided the telecom client with the data needed to take proactive steps to retain these customers, rather than reacting after they had already left.

### Task 3: Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard
**Objective**:  
Analyze gender balance in hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover at the executive management level for a telecom client, with a focus on diversity and inclusion.

- **KPIs included**:
  - Number of male vs. female employees
  - Percentage of women promoted
  - Percentage of hires by gender
  - Average performance rating by gender
  - Employee turnover rates by gender

The telecom client had been striving to improve gender balance at the executive level but was not seeing significant progress. This dashboard provided insights into the hiring and promotion patterns within the company and identified potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving a better gender balance.
